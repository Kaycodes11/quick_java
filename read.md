Learning dsa: don't understand the written code rather understand logic behind it so that it can be explained and written in any language

understanding problem

recognize the main pattern e.g. array, string, ls, bs etc.

how many cases occur by using the recognized pattern?

e.g. bs so mainly it has these cases:

case 1 : mid == target then done 

case 2 : mid < target then start = mid + 1

case 3 : mid > target then end = end - 1

case 4 : return -1 


Medium, hard problems are build on top of easy problem
if "understood question and recognized pattern" then good.
