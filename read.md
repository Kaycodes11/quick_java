# The key Data Structures
array vs linked-list vs tree vs hashmap

# Learning data structures and algorithms: 
To understand the code, understand the logic behind it first & foremost.

N.B: use recursion, when the answer exists within the subsection of given input

# build problem & solving approach

1. first visualize (if necessary) then solve it with pseudocode on pen-paper
2. now, having understanding on the pseudocode/steps from the previous step
3. figure out what's needed to solve each step from these? (variable, fn, if, loop)
4. overall cases, or cases from any steps like what if given input is null, or has length 1
